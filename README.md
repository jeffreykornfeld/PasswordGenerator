# Create a random password

When button is pressed, a function (writePassword) is invoked.
writePassword calls the function generatePassword which does the following:

// asks user the length of the password they would like - value must be between 8 and 128

// asks user if they want uppercase, numbers, or special characters

// concats a string array to include uppercases, numbers, or special characters

// returns generated password

// displays generated password in the textbox on the html.
